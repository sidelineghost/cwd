<!--Reflection:
I chose a book series I greatly enjoyed in my childhood to make a website for. The layout was originally an attempt at a sidebar, taken from many of the gifcities examples I scrolled through. I wanted something calm and peaceful but not plain, and this is what I did. Much of my code was made through experimentation. I had W3schools open on my laptop and collaborated with Savannah to determine a few style elements and table layouts. Until we figured out where to work on Github, we both made our own offline HTML files to work on, and pulled images from their . I found the table layout as it is to be aesthetically pleasing, though it feels a little more modern than the examples.
